## Crossword

This will be a project designed to facilitate the making and solving of crossword puzzles.

I'm using [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) as the back-end PHP Framework, and [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) as the front end Javascript Framework. I also used a template, purchased from [WrapBootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/) as a visual framework.
